# About me

Current *sophomore* at Purdue, and Treasurer of the b01lers CTF team.

My journey in CTFs began in 2022 when I joined the [b01lers](https://b01lersc.tf/) CTF team. I have since then been learning and competing in CTFs, and have been enjoying the experience.

This site contains my tutorials and writeups over the years. I hope you find them useful!

## [Tutorials](/docs/Tutorials/)

Sometimes I write tutorials on various topics, so that people don't have to go throug the same trouble of learning something without good `documentation`.


## [Writeups](/docs/Writeups/)

I also write writeups for CTF challenges that I solve. Though I started in 2022, I don't always create writeups for all the challenges I solve. But I try to write them for the ones that I find interesting or challenging.
